#Map, filter, and reduce are three important built-in functions in Python that allow you to manipulate and process data stored in lists.
#reduce is a function that takes a function and an iterable and returns a single value. It applies the function to the first two elements, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until all elements have been processes
#A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing scope even if they are not in memory.
